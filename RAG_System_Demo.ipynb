    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Authentication** - Login and JWT token management\n",
    "2. ✅ **PDF Generation** - Created a sample ML guide PDF\n",
    "3. ✅ **Collection Creation** - Created a RAG collection\n",
    "4. ✅ **Document Upload** - Uploaded PDF and text documents\n",
    "5. ✅ **Document Listing** - Listed all documents in collection\n",
    "6. ✅ **Semantic Search** - Queried the RAG system with natural language\n",
    "7. ✅ **Document Management** - Deleted individual documents\n",
    "8. ✅ **Collection Management** - Listed and managed collections\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features Demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Per-User Collections**: Each user has isolated RAG storage\n",
    "- **Multi-Format Support**: PDF, TXT, and other formats\n",
    "- **Automatic Chunking**: Documents split into semantic chunks\n",
    "- **Vector Search**: FAISS-powered similarity search\n",
    "- **LLM Enhancement**: Query optimization and answer synthesis\n",
    "- **Document Management**: List, upload, and delete documents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try uploading your own documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)\n",
    "- Experiment with different queries\n",
    "- Adjust chunk size in `config.py`\n",
    "- Create multiple collections for different topics\n",
    "- Integrate RAG into your applications via the API\n",
    "\n",
