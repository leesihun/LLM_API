        "1. ✅ **Authentication** - Login and JWT token management\n",
        "2. ✅ **Multiple PDF Generation** - Created multiple sample PDF documents\n",
        "3. ✅ **Collection Creation** - Created a RAG collection\n",
        "4. ✅ **Batch Document Upload** - Uploaded multiple PDF files simultaneously\n",
        "5. ✅ **Document Listing** - Listed all documents in collection\n",
        "6. ✅ **Semantic Search** - Queried the RAG system with natural language\n",
        "7. ✅ **Document Management** - Deleted individual documents\n",
        "8. ✅ **Collection Management** - Listed and managed collections\n",

        "### Key Features Demonstrated:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Per-User Collections**: Each user has isolated RAG storage\n",
        "- **Multi-Format Support**: PDF, TXT, and other formats\n",
        "- **Batch Upload**: Upload multiple documents at once with progress tracking\n",
        "- **Automatic Chunking**: Documents split into semantic chunks\n",
        "- **Vector Search**: FAISS-powered similarity search\n",
        "- **LLM Enhancement**: Query optimization and answer synthesis\n",
        "- **Document Management**: List, upload, and delete documents\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Try uploading your own PDF documents (multiple files supported!)\n",
        "- Experiment with different queries across multiple documents\n",
        "- Adjust chunk size in `config.py`\n",
        "- Create multiple collections for different topics\n",
        "- Integrate RAG into your applications via the API\n",
