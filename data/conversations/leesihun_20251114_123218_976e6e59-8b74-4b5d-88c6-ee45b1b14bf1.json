Multiply \\(100\\) by \\(0.15\\):\n   \\[\n   100 \\times 0.15 = 15\n   \\]\n  \n2. Add \\(25\\) to the result:\n   \\[\n   15 + 25 = 40\n   \\]\n  \n3. Divide by \\(2\\):\n   \\[\n   40 / 2 = 20\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(20\\)\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2:**\n\nLet's solve the expression step-by-step:\n\\[\n(1007 \\times 1007) / 4524753\n\\]\n  \n1. First, compute \\(1007 \\times 1007\\):\n   \\[\n   1007 \\times 1007 = 1014049\n   \\]\n  \n2. Now, divide the result by \\(4524753\\):\n   \\[\n   1014049 / 4524753 \\approx 0.2246\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** Approximately \\(0.2246\\)\n\n---\n\n**Problem 3:**\n\nLet's explore what \"god\" might be:\n  \n1. **Cosmological View**: In a relativistic context, a god could be considered as an infinitely intelligent entity existing beyond the scope of our universe.\n  \n2. **Philosophical and Theological View**: In many religions and philosophies, a god is seen as a transcendent being who has all that is good and true, including moral values and societal norms.\n\n3. **Socialistic or Materialist Perspective**: Sometimes in sociopolitical discussions, \"god\" might refer to the superintelligent ruler of a society, adhering strictly to material interests over moral considerations.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:** \n\n1. A god could be an infinitely advanced entity beyond our universe.\n  \n2. In many religious and philosophical contexts, a god represents a transcendent being with all good values.\n\n3. In some discussions, \"god\" can refer to the governing figure of a society that prioritizes material success over moral principles.\n\n**Final Answer:** A god could be considered an infinitely advanced entity beyond our universe or a transcendent being in religious and philosophical contexts.",
