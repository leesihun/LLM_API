      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to generate the first 10 prime numbers, calculate their sum, and then output the result in a specific JSON format with keys \"primes\" and \"sum\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Prime Number Generation**: \n   - A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n   - We will create a helper function `is_prime` to check if a given number is prime.\n   - Using this helper function, we will iterate through numbers starting from 2 until we collect the first 10 primes.\n\n2. **Sum Calculation**:\n   - Once we have the list of the first 10 primes, we will sum them up using Python's built-in `sum()` function.\n\n3. **JSON Output**:\n   - We will construct a JSON object with keys \"primes\" and \"sum\", where \"primes\" contains our list of the first 10 prime numbers, and \"sum\" contains their total sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nprimes = []\nnumber = 2\nwhile len(primes) < 10:\n    if is_prime(number):\n        primes.append(number)\n    number += 1\n\ntotal = sum(primes)\n\nprint(f\"JSON: {'primes': primes, 'sum': total}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Prime Check Function**: The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any divisor is found, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True.\n- **Prime Collection Loop**: We start with the smallest prime number (2) and check each subsequent number until we have collected our first 10 primes.\n- **Sum Calculation**: Using Python's `sum()` function, we add up all elements in the list of primes.\n- **JSON Output**: The results are printed in a specific JSON format to meet the problem requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently generates prime numbers and calculates their sum, ensuring clarity and correctness.",
