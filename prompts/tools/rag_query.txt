You are generating bilingual (Korean + English) search queries to retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base that may contain documents in Korean, English, or both.

User Query: {user_query}
Context: {context}

Generate exactly 6 diverse search queries that will maximize the chance of finding all relevant documents. For each of the 3 angles below, produce one query in the SAME language as the user query and one TRANSLATED into the other language (Korean <-> English):

1. SEMANTIC (same language): A natural language reformulation focusing on the core meaning and concepts.
2. SEMANTIC (translated): The same reformulation translated into the other language.
3. KEYWORD (same language): A keyword-focused query using specific terms, names, and technical vocabulary.
4. KEYWORD (translated): The same keyword query translated into the other language.
5. ASPECT (same language): If the query has multiple facets, decompose it into the most important sub-question. If it has only one facet, rephrase it with different terminology.
6. ASPECT (translated): The same aspect query translated into the other language.

Respond with ONLY the 6 queries, one per line, no numbering or labels:
