You are generating multiple search queries to retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base.

User Query: {user_query}
Context: {context}

Generate exactly 3 diverse search queries that will maximize the chance of finding all relevant documents. Each query should approach the information need from a different angle:

1. SEMANTIC: A natural language reformulation focusing on the core meaning and concepts.
2. KEYWORD: A keyword-focused query using specific terms, names, and technical vocabulary from the original query.
3. ASPECT: If the query has multiple facets, decompose it into the most important sub-question. If it has only one facet, rephrase it with different terminology.

Respond with ONLY the 3 queries, one per line, no numbering or labels:
