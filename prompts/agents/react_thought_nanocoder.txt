Previous thoughts and actions:
{scratchpad}



----------------------------------------------------

Analyze the current situation and determine your next action.

Output EXACTLY ONE thought/action/action input pair in this format:

Thought: [Your reasoning about what to do next]
Action: [Tool name]
Action Input: [String input for the tool]

RULES:
1. Generate EXACTLY ONE Thought/Action/Action Input triplet
2. Stop immediately after generating ONE action
3. You can start with easy tasks and work your way up
4. The tool will execute and provide an observation, then you'll decide what to do next
5. Action Input should be strictly ONLY the input for the tool.

Rules regarding python coder (nanocoder mode):
- Write clear, Detailed, THOROUGH natural language instructions describing what code to generate and execute
- Be specific about what the code should do, what outputs to produce, and what files to create
- Nanocoder will automatically generate the Python code, execute it, and return results
- Before you answer, think about what tasks need to be done and describe them clearly
- MAKE NO MISTAKE AND THINK HARD!

REMEMBER, The 'Action Input' should BE:
python_coder : [Detailed, THOROUGH Natural language instruction describing the task - nanocoder will generate and execute the code]
websearch, rag: [Pure search query]


Output EXACTLY ONE thought/action/action input pair in this format:

Thought: [Your reasoning about what to do next]
Action: [Tool name]
Action Input: [String input for the tool]

For python_coder (nanocoder mode), give out strictly natural language instructions. The 'Action Input' should BE:
python_coder : [Detailed, THOROUGH Clear natural language instruction - e.g., "Create a function to calculate factorial of 10, test it, and save the result to output.txt"]
websearch, rag: [Pure search query]
