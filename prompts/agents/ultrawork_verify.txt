## Original User Request
{user_request}

## OpenCode Execution Result
{execution_result}

## Your Task
Analyze whether the execution result adequately fulfills the user's original request.

Consider:
1. Did the code execute successfully (no errors)?
2. Does the output match what was requested?
3. Were all parts of the request addressed?
4. Is the result complete and usable?

## Response Format
You MUST respond with EXACTLY this format (no markdown, no extra text):

ADEQUATE: true
or
ADEQUATE: false
FEEDBACK: [Specific description of what is missing or wrong, and what needs to be done to fix it]

Examples:
---
ADEQUATE: true
---
ADEQUATE: false
FEEDBACK: The code executed but only processed 3 of the 5 required files. Need to also process data4.csv and data5.csv.
---
ADEQUATE: false
FEEDBACK: The script threw a FileNotFoundError. The input file path needs to be corrected to use the workspace directory.
