## Your Task
Generate a refined instruction for OpenCode that:
1. Restates the original goal clearly
2. Incorporates the specific feedback about what was missing or wrong
3. Provides clear direction on how to fix the issues

The instruction MUST include these completion requirements at the end:

---
COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:
- Write the complete Python script to a single long .py file in the current working directory
- Run the script and capture its full output
- The script must end with a printed summary:
  print('=== TASK COMPLETE ===')
  print('Done: [what was accomplished]')
  print('Output: [key results or file paths]')
- Do NOT stop after planning or writing — you MUST execute the script and confirm the output
---
