{scratchpad}



----------------------------------------------------

Analyze the current situation and determine your next action.

Output EXACTLY ONE thought/action/action input pair in this format:

Thought: [Your reasoning about what to do next]
Action: [Tool name]
Action Input: [String input for the tool]

RULES:
1. Generate EXACTLY ONE Thought/Action/Action Input triplet
2. Stop immediately after generating ONE action
3. You can start with easy tasks and work your way up
4. The tool will execute and provide an observation, then you'll decide what to do next
5. Action Input should be strictly ONLY the input for the tool.

Rules regarding python coder:
- Write thorough code that can answer the given task.
- Always save important variables that might be used in the future.
- Before you answer, reexamine the codeset.
- MAKE NO MISTAKE AND THINK HARD!

REMEMBER, The 'Action Input' should BE:
python_coder : [DETAILED python code including error messages]
websearch, rag: [Pure search query]


Output EXACTLY ONE thought/action/action input pair in this format:

Thought: [Your reasoning about what to do next]
Action: [Tool name]
Action Input: [String input for the tool]

For python_coder and websearch, give out strictly the followings, no additional text, json format, etc. The 'Action Input' should BE:
python_coder : [DETAILED python code including error messages]
websearch, rag: [Pure search query]
