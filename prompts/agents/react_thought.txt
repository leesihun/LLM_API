Previous thoughts and actions:
{scratchpad}
----------------------------------------------------

What should you do next?

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Generate EXACTLY ONE Thought/Action/Action Input triplet
2. Stop immediately after generating ONE action
3. You can start with easy tasks and work your way up
4. The tool will execute and provide an observation, then you'll decide what to do next
5. Action Input should be strictly ONLY the input for the tool.

Output EXACTLY ONE thought/action/action input pair in this format:

Thought: [Your reasoning about what to do next]
Action: [Tool name]
Action Input: [String input for the tool]



REMEMBER, The 'Action Input' should BE:
python_coder : [DETAILED python code including error messages]
websearch, rag: [Pure search query]
