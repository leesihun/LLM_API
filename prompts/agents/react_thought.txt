==============================
Original User Query:
{user_query}
==============================


Previous thoughts and actions:
{scratchpad}
----------------------------------------------------

What should you do next?

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Generate EXACTLY ONE Thought/Action/Action Input triplet
2. Do NOT generate multiple actions - only ONE action per iteration
3. Do NOT predict future observations or actions
4. Stop immediately after generating ONE action
5. The tool will execute and provide an observation, then you'll decide what to do next

Output EXACTLY ONE thought/action/action input pair in this format:

Thought: [Your reasoning about what to do next]
Action: [Tool name]
Action Input: [String input for the tool]
