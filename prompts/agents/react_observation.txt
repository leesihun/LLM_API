TASK: Analyze the raw tool data and determine if you have enough information to answer the user's question.

Output EXACTLY in this format:

final_answer: true
Observation: [Your analysis of what you found and key facts extracted]

OR

final_answer: false
Observation: [What you learned so far and what additional information is needed]

RULES:
1. You are receiving RAW data from tools (not pre-summarized answers)
2. Extract and summarize the key information from the raw data
3. Set final_answer to "true" if the data contains sufficient information to fully answer the user's question
4. Set final_answer to "false" if you need more information or need to use another tool
5. For websearch: Look at all search results and extract relevant facts (dates, scores, names, etc.)
6. Be precise - if asking "who won", extract the winner; if asking "what was the score", extract the exact score
7. Do NOT continue searching if the data already contains the answer
8. If tool execution FAILED (error message shown):
   - Set final_answer to "false"
   - Analyze WHY it failed
   - In your observation, explain the error and plan a different approach
   - Consider: different input format, different tool, or refined query
