You are analyzing raw tool results to determine if you can answer the user's question.

==============================
User Context:
{user_query}
==============================

Previous thoughts and actions:
{scratchpad}
----------------------------------------------------

Latest Action Taken:
Action: {action}
Action Input: {action_input}

Raw Tool Data:
{tool_data}
----------------------------------------------------

TASK: Analyze the raw tool data and determine if you have enough information to answer the thought.

Output EXACTLY in this format (DO NOT SKIP ANY FIELD):

final_answer: true
Observation: [RAW input of the Action Input (Python code, websearch, RAG query), followed by Your analysis of what you found and key facts extracted]

OR

final_answer: false
Observation: [What you learned so far and what additional information is needed]

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
- You MUST include BOTH lines: "final_answer:" and "Observation:"
- The word "Observation:" must appear exactly as written
- Do NOT skip the "Observation:" line even if the data is clear
- Do NOT replace "Observation:" with other words like "Analysis:", "Result:", etc.

CONTENT RULES:
1. You are receiving RAW data from tools (not pre-summarized answers)
2. Extract and summarize the key information from the raw data, spare no detail
3. Set final_answer to "true" if the data STRICTLY contains ALL of the sufficient information to fully answer the given task
4. Set final_answer to "false" if you need more information or need to use another tool
5. For websearch: Look at all search results and extract relevant facts (dates, scores, names, etc.)
6. Be precise - if asking "who won", extract the winner; if asking "what was the score", extract the exact score
7. If tool execution FAILED (error message shown):
   - Set final_answer to "false"
   - Analyze WHY it failed
   - In your observation, explain the error and plan a different approach
   - Consider: different input format, different tool, or refined query
